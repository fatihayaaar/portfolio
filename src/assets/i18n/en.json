  "description" : "Hello, Iâ€™m Fatih Ayar.\n\nI embarked on my journey in the software world at the age of 15, and since then, I have continuously developed myself, building a strong career in technology. I started by developing native mobile applications using Java and later moved on to creating cross-platform solutions with Flutter. With Java Spring, I gained deep expertise in both monolithic and microservice architectures, specializing in back-end development.\n\nIn these projects, I focused on delivering user-friendly experiences by building web interfaces with Angular. I see following new technologies and continuous learning as integral parts of my life. I actively apply my software development skills in both my professional work and personal projects, always aiming for innovation and improvement. Education is a passion of mine; I am committed to pushing myself further and continuously advancing in this ever-evolving field."
